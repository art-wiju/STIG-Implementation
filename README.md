# DoD STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide) Implementations 

Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are official cybersecurity guidelines developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. They provide detailed instructions for securing systems, software, and networks against known vulnerabilities. STIGs help ensure that IT environments meet strict security standards, protect sensitive information, and reduce the risk of cyberattacks. STIGs are similar to frameworks like the CIS Controls and NIST SP 800-53, but they are typically more prescriptive and military-focused, aiming for strict compliance in high-security environments.

- CIS Controls provide prioritized, general best practices for cybersecurity across industries.

- NIST 800-53 offers a broad catalog of security controls for federal systems but leaves room for tailoring.

- STIGs lock down specific technologies (like Windows Server, SQL Server, or Cisco devices) to meet Department of Defense-level security standards.

You can find official STIGs documentation and downloads at the DISA STIGs [website](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/).

This repository contains scripts and resources to automate applying and verifying STIG compliance on Windows systems that I have personally created and used.
